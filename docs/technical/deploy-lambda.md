# GitHub Actions AWS Lambda Deployment Checklist

This checklist outlines every step required to set up a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds, packages, and deploys your AWS Lambda function.

---

## 1. Basic Workflow Setup

- [x] **Create Workflow File**
  - Create a file at `.github/workflows/deploy-lambda.yml`.
- [x] **Configure Trigger**
  - Set the workflow to trigger on pushes to the `main` branch.
- [x] **Test Workflow Execution**
  - Add a simple job that logs a message (e.g., "Hello, Lambda!") to ensure the workflow file is recognized.

---

## 2. Repository Checkout

- [x] **Add Checkout Step**
  - Include a step using `actions/checkout@v3` to check out your repository code.
  - Verify that the code is available to subsequent steps.

---

## 3. Node.js Environment Setup

- [x] **Set Up Node.js**
  - Add a step using `actions/setup-node@v3` to install Node.js (e.g., version 16).
  - Confirm that the correct Node.js version is installed.

---

## 4. Install Dependencies and Build Project

- [x] **Install Dependencies**
  - Add a step to run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
- [x] **Build Project**
  - Add a step to run `npm run build` to compile your TypeScript code (or build your project) into the `dist` folder.
  - Verify that the `dist` folder contains the expected output files.

---

## 5. Package the Build Output

- [x] **Package Build Files**
  - Add a step to change into the `dist` directory, run a zip command to package all files into `lambda.zip`, and then return to the project root.
  - Confirm that the `lambda.zip` file is created successfully.

---

## 6. Configure AWS Credentials

- [x] **Setup AWS Credentials**
  - Add a step using `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2` to configure AWS credentials.
  - Ensure GitHub Secrets (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and optionally `AWS_REGION`) are configured in your repository.
  - Verify that the credentials are correctly applied.

---

## 7. Deploy to AWS Lambda

- [x] **Deploy the Lambda Function**
  - Add a step to deploy your Lambda function using the AWS CLI command.
  - Replace `your-lambda-function-name` with your actual Lambda function name.
  - Verify that the deployment command outputs a success message and that AWS Lambda is updated.

---

## 8. Final Integration Testing

- [x] **Test the Complete Workflow**
  - Added test step before deployment
  - Added deployment verification step
  - Added automatic rollback on failure

---

## 9. Documentation and Best Practices

- [x] **Document the Setup**
  - Created comprehensive deployment documentation in `docs/deployment.md`
  - Included details on GitHub Secrets configuration
  - Added troubleshooting guide
- [x] **Plan for Future Enhancements**
  - Added Slack notifications for deployment status
  - Implemented rollback steps for failed deployments
  - Added deployment verification steps

---

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that all commands and steps are tested locally (or in a test branch) before relying on the automated deployment.
- Keep your GitHub Secrets up to date and monitor AWS Lambda logs after each deployment to catch any runtime issues.
