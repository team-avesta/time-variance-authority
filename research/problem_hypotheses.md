# Problem Hypotheses for Clockify Non-Compliance

## Friction Hypotheses
1. **Entry Friction**: The process of entering time takes too many clicks/steps
2. **Context Switching**: Having to stop work to log time disrupts flow
3. **UI Complexity**: Clockify interface may be overwhelming or confusing

## Habit/Behavior Hypotheses
4. **Lack of Reminders**: Users don't have effective cues to trigger the behavior
5. **No Established Routine**: Time tracking isn't embedded in users' daily workflow
6. **Delayed Feedback Loop**: The consequences of not tracking come too late

## Motivation Hypotheses
7. **Value Misalignment**: Users don't personally benefit from tracking time
8. **Negative Perception**: Time tracking feels like surveillance rather than a useful tool
9. **Missing Social Proof**: No visibility into how/when peers are tracking time

## Technical Hypotheses
10. **Tool Isolation**: Clockify doesn't integrate with other workflow tools
11. **Device Limitations**: Limited access on mobile or specific environments
12. **Performance Issues**: Slow loading or response times when logging entries

## Role-Specific Hypotheses

### Developer Hypotheses
13. **Flow Disruption**: Time tracking interrupts deep coding sessions
14. **Task Granularity**: Difficult to track multiple small coding tasks accurately
15. **Estimation Complexity**: Hard to estimate time for debugging or research tasks

### Tech Lead Hypotheses
16. **Meeting Density**: High volume of meetings makes tracking difficult
17. **Context Variety**: Wide range of activities are hard to categorize
18. **Team Support Role**: Time spent helping others is difficult to track
19. **Managerial Overhead**: Reviewing team's time entries adds to tracking burden

## Validation Plan
For each hypothesis:
1. Identify key questions to validate/invalidate
2. Determine data collection method (interviews, surveys, usage metrics)
3. Set criteria for confirming/rejecting the hypothesis
