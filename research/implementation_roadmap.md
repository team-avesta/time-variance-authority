# TVA Enhancement Roadmap

## Phase 1: Research (2 Weeks)

- **Week 1: Data Collection**
  - Conduct 5-7 user interviews with mix of compliant/non-compliant users
    - Ensure representation from different personas (Developers, Tech Leads, PMs)
  - Send role-categorized survey to all Clockify users
  - Analyze Clockify usage patterns from existing data (segmented by role)
  - Competitive analysis of time tracking solutions

- **Week 2: Problem Definition**
  - Synthesize research findings (overall and by persona)
  - Validate/invalidate hypotheses
  - Define 2-3 core problems to solve (with persona specificity)
  - Create problem statement document

## Phase 2: Solution Ideation (1 Week)

- **Day 1-2: Divergent Thinking**
  - Brainstorming session with stakeholders (include representatives from each persona)
  - Map solutions to validated problems
  - Generate 10+ potential approaches (general and persona-specific)

- **Day 3-5: Convergent Thinking**
  - Evaluate solutions on impact/effort matrix
  - Select 2-3 solutions for prototyping
  - Create basic solution specs

## Phase 3: Rapid Prototyping (2 Weeks)

- **Week 1: Prototype Development**
  - Build minimum viable versions of solutions
  - Focus on core functionality, not polish
  - Prepare testing protocols

- **Week 2: Initial Testing**
  - Test with 5-7 users
  - Collect feedback
  - Iterate on prototypes

## Phase 4: Pilot Implementation (3 Weeks)

- **Week 1: Refinement**
  - Update solution based on testing feedback
  - Create implementation plan
  - Document requirements for development

- **Week 2-3: Limited Rollout**
  - Implement with small team (5-10 users)
  - Monitor usage and gather feedback
  - Make final adjustments

## Phase 5: Full Deployment (2 Weeks)

- **Week 1: Preparation**
  - Create rollout communication plan
  - Prepare training materials
  - Set up metrics tracking

- **Week 2: Launch**
  - Roll out to all users
  - Provide support and training
  - Begin collecting metrics

## Phase 6: Evaluation & Iteration (Ongoing)

- Monthly review of compliance metrics
- Quarterly adjustment of approach
- Continuous improvement cycle
